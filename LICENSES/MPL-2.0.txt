    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

You may exercise the rights granted under this License based on Your
interpretation of (i) the license terms of this License, (ii) the
license terms of any Secondary License, and (iii) the copyright laws or
the doctrine of fair use, fair dealing, or their equivalents, as applicable
to Your jurisdiction.

2.7. Conditions

The grants under this License are subject to the following conditions:

(a) You may not distribute or make available Covered Software in any form
    except as expressly permitted under this License.

(b) You must cause any Covered Software that You distribute to be
    licensed under this License to any recipient receiving such Covered
    Software. You must also make available the Source Code of such
    Covered Software to all recipients, either by providing the Source
    Code with the Executable Form or by making the Source Code available
    from a network server at no charge.

(c) You must cause any Modifications that You distribute to be licensed
    under this License to any recipient receiving such Modifications.
    You must also make available the Source Code of such Modifications
    to all recipients, either by providing the Source Code with the
    Executable Form or by making the Source Code available from a
    network server at no charge.

(d) If the Covered Software includes notices stating that it is governed
    by this License, then You must include a copy of this License with
    every copy of the Covered Software that You distribute.

(e) You may not remove or alter any license notices, copyright notices,
    or other notices stating that this License governs any portion of
    the Covered Software. You may not license or distribute any
    modifications under any other license except as required by Section
    3.3 or 3.4.

(f) If You distribute Covered Software, You must cause any executable
    form of such Covered Software that You distribute to be accompanied
    by a prominent notice offering recipients the ability to obtain the
    Source Code of such Covered Software at no charge. The notice may
    be included in a notice file or displayed with the executable
    form.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Code

You may distribute the Source Code of the Covered Software under this
License either (a) together with the Executable Form, or (b) by making
the Source Code available from a network server at no charge.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

You may distribute the Executable Form of the Covered Software under
this License provided that You:

(a) accompany all copies with the machine-readable Source Code; or

(b) make the Source Code available via a network server at no charge
    and inform recipients how to obtain it.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work includes a "NOTICE" text file
as part of its distribution, then any Covered Software in the Larger
Work must include the notices in Exhibit A within such NOTICE file.

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the terms of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
limitations of liability) contained in the Covered Software. You must
retain all patent, copyright, trademark, and attribution notices.

If You modify the Covered Software, You must cause the modified files
to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of
your accepting any such warranty or other liability.

4. Inability to Comply
----------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must:
(a) comply to the minimum extent possible; and (b) notify the
Contributor of the impossibility. If it is impossible for You to comply
with the obligations of Section 3.2 or 3.3 due to a claim of patent
infringement, then You must either (a) cease distribution of the
Covered Software or (b) implement a work-around.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant with all terms, then the rights granted by this License from
a particular Contributor are reinstated.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered
Software or a Contribution incorporated within the Covered Software
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
licenses granted to You under this License for that Covered Software
shall terminate.

5.3. If the rights granted under this License have terminated, but
 Your patent license from a Contributor does not terminate, then such
 patent license shall include a termination clause similar to that
 set forth in Section 5.2.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN
ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.
NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER.

(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction defined in clause 16.4 below or within the
jurisdiction agreed to by the parties.

9. Miscellaneous

matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.
